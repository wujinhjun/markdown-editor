# Wujinhjun's markdown editor

This is the cs50x's final project, a simple markdown editor.

***

## some helpful tools

At the beginning, maybe I need to introduce I had used open source part.  

The core of this project is [easy markdown editor](https://github.com/RIP21/react-simplemde-editor)

This project based on the [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) and the [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)

The style from the [sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) and [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)

Of course, I made my scaffold for electron and react, this is the [address](https://github.com/wujinhjun/electron-react-scaffold)

In this editor, you can use many shortcuts to increase efficiency.

You can use the toolbar on the top, which can preview the markdown and change the title or many things.

## At the end

*I must say, the typescript is more powerful than the javascript. When I start this project, However, I can't handle typescript. So, I have to use javascript to finish this project.*
